/**
 * MultiThreadIntentService is a base class for {@link Service}s that handle asynchronous requests
 * (expressed as {@link Intent}s) on demand. Clients send requests through
 * {@link android.content.Context#startService(Intent)} calls; the service is started as needed,
 * handles each Intent in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.
 * <p>
 * This "work queue processor" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks from an application's main
 * thread. The MultiThreadedIntentService class exists to simplify this pattern and take care of the
 * mechanics. To use it, extend MultiThreadedIntentService and implement
 * {@link #onHandleIntent(Intent)}. MultiThreadedIntentService will receive the Intents, launch a
 * worker thread, and stop the service as appropriate.
 * <p>
 * All requests are handled on multiple worker threads -- they may take as long as necessary (and
 * will not block the application's main loop). By default only one concurrent worker thread is
 * used. You can modify the number of current worker threads by overriding
 * {@link #getMaximumNumberOfThreads()}.
 * <p>
 * For obvious efficiency reasons, MultiThreadedIntentService won't stop itself as soon as all tasks
 * has been processed. It will only stop itself after a certain delay (about 30s). This optimization
 * prevents the system from creating new instances over and over again when tasks are sent.
